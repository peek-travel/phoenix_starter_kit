# Fly.io Deployment Files

This directory contains all Fly.io-specific files for deploying this application to Fly.io.

## Contents

- **`proxy_prod`** - Script to proxy production database locally (will be copied to `bin/`)
- **`shell_prod`** - Script to open IEx shell on production (will be copied to `bin/`)
- **`deploy.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment (will be copied to `.github/workflows/`)

Note: `fly.toml` is not included here because it's generated by `fly launch` based on your specific app configuration.

## Usage

To enable Fly.io deployment support, run:

```bash
bin/enable-flyio
```

This will copy all necessary files to their proper locations in your project.

## Why is this separate?

This starter kit is designed to be deployment-agnostic. By keeping Fly.io-specific files in this directory, the project remains clean and can be deployed to any platform (Render, Heroku, Gigalixir, etc.) without Fly.io-specific clutter.

Only enable Fly.io support if you plan to deploy to Fly.io.
